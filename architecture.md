# 2. Service responsibility overview

TODO not sure if user service & agency should be merged into one

## 2.1. User service
  - database: none
  - authorization
  - takes REST calls from frontend & passes it on to the message broker
  - subscribes to certain Agency messages to create HTTP responses for clients
  - websocket endpoints for offer status updates?

## 2.2. Agency
  - database: SQL
  - stores information about its clients and authenticates them
  - event-sourced entity: OfferBooking (offerid, birthdates, status)

## 2.3. Tour Operator (commands)
  - database: SQL
  - event-sourced entity: Offer
  - generates offers (one-time call)
  - listens to World events & Agency booking requests to update offer status
  - provides snapshots for query server

## 2.4. Tour Operator (queries)
  - database: MongoDB
  - stores relatively recent information about offers
  - is able to quickly provide a filtered list of offers

## 2.5. World
  - database: MongoDB?
  - listens to (& may generate) seat/room booking events
  - maintains information about available hotel rooms & plane seats
  - notifies any external services about changed availability status
    - e.g. "hotel LCA20064 will have no vacancy from 18.06 until 21.06" is
      an event that Tour Operator may subscribe to, which may invalidate an offer

## 2.6. Saga Orchestrator
  - orchestrates Sagas. more in [3. Saga descriptions](#3-saga-descriptions-1)

# 3. Saga descriptions

## 3.1. Booking an offer
  1. [Agency] Create `OfferBooking` and init status to "waiting" (rollback: don't delete, set status to "error")
  2. [World] Try to book airplane seats
  3. [World] Try to book hotel rooms
  4. [Tour Operator] Acknowledge offer sale
  5. [Agency] Update status to "booked" and wait 1 minute for payment confirmation
  6. [Agency] Update status to "done"

no more sagas are necessary imo

# 4. REST API overview

HTTP communication only happens between the frontend and the User service.
All other services communicate using the message broker.
