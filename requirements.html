			Description of the project
			(RSWW 2022)
		</h1>
		<p>
			The project consists of two parts. Each of them should be
			presented during the project classes, in accordance with
			the requirements of the teacher.
		</p>
		<p>
			The project is carried out in student teams of 2 to 4
			people.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main topic of the project implementation is the
			system for servicing customers interested in purchasing
			tourist offers.
		</p>
		<p>
			An absolute requirement is to develop an application in a
			microservice architecture that uses brokered messages
			for communication between components. Patterns
			required for use: CQRS, Event Sourcing and Saga.
		</p>
		<p>Completion dates: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Stage 1 - includes:
				<ul>
					<li>
						development of a scrapper for the selected Tour
						Operator's offer (e.g. Itaka, Coral Travel,
						Rainbow Tours, etc.)
					</li>
					<li>
						designing the application and preparing project
						documentation
					</li>
					<li>
						implementation of the required functionalities
						described below
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Stage 2 - includes:
				<ul>
					<li>
						implementation of the required functionalities
						described below
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Description of the target application</h2>
		<p>In the application, we distinguish the following actors:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				TO - Tour operator, i.e. a company that organizes
				trips and provides information about its offer to travel
				agencies;
			</li>
			<li>
				Travel agency - seller of offers (broker) who signs a
				contract with the client;
			</li>
			<li>
				Client - a person interested in purchasing a trip that
				uses the services of a travel agency
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The data flow will be as follows: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				TO issues and manages its offer;
			</li>
			<li>
				The travel agency presents TO's offer and collects
				reservations and orders (by providing information to
				TO);
			</li>
			<li>
				The customer selects an offer, reserves or buys it
				and receives a purchase confirmation.
			</li>
			<li>
				Other travel agents may also sell offers and inform
				TO. TO can send updates to the travel agency
				regarding the change of available resources.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			Scrapper is a program that will allow you to create initial
			datasets on hotels, available transport methods,
			departure / arrival destinations, hotel room types, and tour
			options. The created dataset is to be used to initialize the
			application. Scrapper does not obtain detailed information
			about available flights, available places in hotels, etc.
			Students generate this type of data themselves.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note that the tour is a general product description. The
			offer is a specific configuration of the trip, i.e. how many
			people go, at what age, what method of transport it uses,
			where it leaves from, what hotel it will be accommodated
			in, what type of room etc. Also note that TO reserves N
			places in a hotel that is associated with several trips. He
			also has to reserve a few seats on the plane, e.g. from
			Gda≈Ñsk to Hurghada. However, such a hotel can be linked
			to several different trips, and places on the plane can be
			offered simultaneously in several trips. Depending on the
			occupancy of the hotel / plane, the specific offer (s) may
			become unavailable. The locations in the hotel / plane
			determine the available tour dates. This means that the
			total number of seats on the various tours exceeds the
			physical number of seats booked on the plane and hotel
			seats. Also, remember that places in hotels may differ, e.g.
			in the size of the room, amenities, admitting or not
			children. Treat general information about tours separately
			with information about resources that determine the
			availability of specific offers.
		</p>

		<h3>Requirements for the target application:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Presentation of the offer of available tourist
				destinations;
			</li>
			<li>
				Searching for a trip based on the following criteria:
				destination, date of departure, place of departure,
				number of people (distinguishing between adults and
				children - up to 3 years old, up to 10 years old, up to
				18 years old);
			</li>
			<li>
				Informing about the availability of the offer (the offer
				is a trip for a specific configuration: number and type
				of people, selected hotel at the destination, selected
				types and number of rooms (small, medium, large,
				apartment, studio), selected type of transport (own,
				train, bus, plane), selected departure date, number of
				days, selected meals, use of the available promotion)
				- the availability of offers may change in real time; if
				the offer is related to the plane, it is a specific flight
				and we have a limited number of seats there; one
				plane can be associated with several trips - because
				it flies to one airport in the destination country - so
				the plane may run out of seats;
			</li>
			<li>
				Calculation of the price for the selected offer -
				propose in the documentation a price calculation
				algorithm that takes into account the attributes listed
				in the offer description;
			</li>
			<li>
				Possibility to book a selected offer (automatically
				resources related to the configuration should
				become unavailable to other customers for 1 minute;
				after this time, if it is not purchased, the reserved
				resources return to the pool) with a simulation of
				waiting for an advance payment by card (for random
				transactions, please return the answer that the
				payment was unsuccessful);
			</li>
			<li>
				Possibility to purchase a selected offer (means a
				permanent reduction of resources related to the
				offer) with a simulation of waiting for card payment
				as above; The message about the purchase of a
				specific offer should be issued on an additional
				queue, dedicated to communication with the TO
				system (implementation of this system is not
				required).
			</li>
			<li>
				Possibility of presenting information in real time on
				the website that someone else has purchased an
				offer related to the tour currently being viewed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Presentation of information (in real time) about the
				preferences of customers who make a reservation or
				purchase an offer (preferences regarding departure
				directions).
			</li>
			<li>
				Presentation of information (in real time) about the
				preferences of customers making reservations or
				purchasing an offer (preferences regarding hotels,
				types of rooms, type of transport)
			</li>
			<li>
				Preparation of a mechanism for real-time import of
				data on changes in the TO offer. The import process
				is to be asynchronous. An additional data generator
				must be created to simulate a data change on the TO
				side. Please note that TO may change the availability
				of the offer viewed / booked / purchased by the
				customer. The price of such an offer may also change
				in real time. Registered changes in the offer should
				be presented in real time. In addition, for a test
				purpose, create a page in the user interface to
				present a list of the 10 most recent changes.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>1st stage</h2>
		<p>
			The first stage includes, inter alia, develop the system
			architecture, i.e .:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Division into components (services), the scope of
				their responsibility and indication of aggregates (1
				point);
			</li>
			<li>
				Database schemas for components with the
				distinction of SQL and noSQL databases (1 point);	
			</li>
			<li>
				Development of a list of endpoints and events
				supported by individual components (1 point);	
			</li>
			<li>
				Sag definitions broken down by components and an
				indication of transactions, their reservation and methods of
				rollback (1 point)
			</li>
			<li>
				You can earn an additional point for a complete class
				diagram with methods (1 point);
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Then prepare the implementation of the application
			functionality that will meet the requirements from 1 to 6.
			The entire application should be divided into
			containerized components. Each component is distributed
			as an image. The process of implementing the application
			on a cluster includes the delivery of the dockercompose.yml 
			file and possibly SQL scripts for data
			initialization.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the component requires a SQL or noSQL database, a
			shared server available on the cluster should be used.
			Which means we don't run our database system as part of
			the theme.			
		</p>
		<p>
			The team should set limits for the available tour
			configurations (offers), so that during the tests it can be
			shown that certain configurations ended during the tests.
		</p>
		<p>
			Acceptable technologies for creating backend services:
			.NET, Java Spring. Acceptable technologies for creating
			frontend services: Angular, React.JS, Vue.JS (or Nuxtjs).			
		</p>
		<p>
			Provide a message queuing (broker) system as part of
			your own stack.			
		</p>
		<p>
			The team should also prepare Selenium scripts for
			acceptance testing. During the presentation of the
			solution:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Present the method of deploying the application to
				the cluster (docker-compose.yml file, Dockerfile files
				and the answer for the command: sudo docker stack
				ps [stack-name]
			</li>
			<li>
				Present the logs for the main services in the theme
				(before running the scripts for testing, pin the
				console to the logs of these services with the
				command: sudo docker service logs [service
				number] -f. The logs should be visible throughout
				the tests.
			</li>
			<li>
				Provide other members of the teams in the room
				with: the address of the server of your application
				and the necessary data enabling the use of the
				application.
			</li>
			<li>
				The prepared application should be simultaneously
				tested by persons during the design classes after
				receiving such information from the teacher;
			</li>
			<li>
				During tests conducted by other people, the team
				prepares the acceptance test scripts.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			The first team that leads to an application error (500,
			suspension, timeout, etc.) on the application side receives
			an additional 1 point (once), and the presenting team
			loses 1 point.
		</p>

		<p>
			The instructor may indicate additional activities checking
			the application.
		</p>

		<p>
			Scoring for implementation:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Correct implementation of services in the cluster and
				the ability to use the application via a web browser (1
				point);
			</li>
			<li>
				Compliance of the application with the
				documentation presented in the first stage or
				justification of the introduced changes (1 point);
			</li>
			<li>
				Flawless execution of acceptance tests with the use
				of the created script (1 point);
			</li>
			<li>
				Compliance of the application with the functional
				requirements [requirements 1 to 6] (1 point).
			</li>
			<li>
				Additional point for finding a bug in another team's
				application;
			</li>
			
		</ol>
		<p>
			Attention! If the team intentionally left mocks for selected
			(not described in the requirements) functions, it should be
			communicated on the screen. We do not leave the
			interface functions unhandled.
		</p>

		<p>
			Attention! During the presentation of the project by one
			team, other teams do not make changes to the cluster
			and do not test their own application.
		</p>

		<p>
			Maximum number of points to earn: 10 points. You should
			score at least half the points for the documentation part
			and half the points for the implementation part. Lecturers
			can award fractional points.
		</p>

		<h2>2nd stage</h2>
		<p>
			The second stage concerns the processing of information
			in real time and the presentation of the results via the user
			interface. This part of the project covers the requirements
			7 to 10.
		</p>
		<p>
			In reservation to complete this step, each team will prepare a
			configuration that will automatically record the necessary
			types of events in an additional message queue.
		</p>
		<p>
			The data from this queue is to be processed by separate
			components that will update the availability and prices of
			offers (requirement 10) and will generate the statistics
			described in requirements 7 to 9.
		</p>
		<p>
			The presentation of the required functionality will also be
			carried out inside project groups. The presentation team
			will provide the other people in the room with the data
			needed to use the developed application.
		</p>
		<p>
			The duration of the tests is 5 minutes. During this time, all
			people in the room use the functions to search, book or
			purchase tours. The lecturer observes the results
			presented in the application. In addition, the tutor may
			indicate to individuals what criteria should be followed
			during the tests.
		</p>
		
		<p>Punctation:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Requirement no. 7 (1 point);</li>
			<li>Requirement no. 8 (2 points);</li>
			<li>Requirement 9 (2 points);</li>
			<li>Requirement no. 10 (4 points);</li>
			<li>
				1 additional point for finding a bug in another team's
				application (only the first team to find a bug is
				awarded);				
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			There are 10 points in total for the second stage. The
			team must score a minimum of 5 points.
		</p>
		<p>Assessment process:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Presentation to the lecturer of a correctly
				implemented application on the cluster (sudo docker
				stack ps [stack name])
			</li>
			<li>
				Initialization of data for acceptance testing;
			</li>
			<li>
				Providing the necessary data to other team members
				present in the room;
			</li>
			<li>
				Launching a separate window with the customer
				preferences view;
			</li>
			<li>
				Launch of a separate window with the history of
				changes in the offer;
			</li>
			<li>
				Launching the data generator simulating TO on
				request;
			</li>
			<li>
				Commencement of testing by other project teams;
			</li>
			<li>
				Launching Selenium tests prepared in the first stage;
			</li>
			<li>
				Waiting for Selenium and other users' tests to be
				completed (5 minutes).
			</li>
			
		</ol>
		<p>
			Attention! During the presentation of the project by one
			team, other teams do not make changes to the cluster
			and do not test their own application.
		</p>
		<h2>Final remarks</h2>
		<p>
			The goal of the project is not to create the target product,
			but to focus on the implementation of modules
			communicating with each other asynchronously.
			Therefore, you should not focus on the styling of the user
			interface, on the security of the registration / login
			mechanism. You can prepare 10 customer accounts and
			make a simple form. Don't write a complete product, but
			focus on meeting the requirements.
